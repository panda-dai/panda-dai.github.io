Leaving a background in Electrical Engineering where I play with Electronic Circuit, I now get to be the one creating solutions, bringing to the table the unique insight, managing data, implementing creative solutions for challenging problems, and making a difference.

I will demonstrate determination and grit when it comes to learning new skills.I will make great effort to go above and beyond while fulfilling all tasks given to me.I am the guy that gets it done.

The transformation has been one of the most exciting yet challenging journeys I’ve experienced in my life. Not every day was easy, but I continued to move forward because I felt passionate about something I’m excited about. So far it looks like it has been the right decision.
